# ANML
This repository contains tools for generating ANML Files.

The Automata Network Markup Language (ANML) is a file format that describes Homogeneous finite state automata. This repository contains tools for generating and manipulating ANML files for interoperability with other Automata Processing tools.

For the time being, this module can only be used with Python3.0 and has support for STE-only automata.
